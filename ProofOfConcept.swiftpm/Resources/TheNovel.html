    <h1>The Novel</h1>
    <p><b>Dracula</b> is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. The novel tells the story of Count Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse, and of the battle between Dracula and a small group of people led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing.</p>
    <h2>Whitby and Dracula</h2>
    <p>Whitby, with its dramatic coastline and ruined abbey, inspired Stoker's vision of Dracula's arrival in England. Many key scenes in the novel are set in Whitby, including the famous shipwreck of the Demeter.</p>
