Project Notes and Context for Resuming Tomorrow

Overview

We are working on an iOS SwiftUI app that hosts a horizontally paging UIScrollView of UIViews.  
The views are dynamically generated based on JSON configuration.  
The core components are:

- TitleScreenView: Initial view on app launch. Itâ€™s always the first page and should never be removed or interfered with.
- ApplicationView: The main container UIView holding all pages in a horizontal UIScrollView with paging enabled.
- MenuPageView: A UIView subclass representing a menu with buttons generated from JSON children.  
  Clicking a button triggers loading a corresponding page.
- PlaceholderPageView: Simple UIView showing a title label and background color from JSON.
- PageData and CodablePageData: Models representing the JSON configuration and runtime data.

---

What We Have Implemented

1. JSON Driven Views

- JSON defines a hierarchy of pages with:
  - viewClass (e.g., "MenuPageView" or "PlaceholderPageView")
  - label for button labels or titles
  - data dictionary for view-specific data (e.g., titles, colors)
  - children array for nested pages

- JSON is parsed into CodablePageData, then converted to PageData for runtime use.

2. PageView Protocol

- Protocol implemented by all pages (MenuPageView, PlaceholderPageView) defining a common init:
  init(data: [String: Any], children: [PageData]?, callback: @escaping () -> Void)

- This allows dynamic creation of views based on JSON.

3. MenuPageView

- Renders buttons for its children.
- Clicking a button:
  - Prints the corresponding PageData to console.
  - Calls a callback closure to notify ApplicationView.

4. ApplicationView

- Holds an array of pages as arranged subviews in a horizontal UIStackView inside a paging UIScrollView.
- Starts with TitleScreenView page.
- Loads root MenuPageView from JSON config.
- Dynamically creates views from JSON data.
- When a MenuPageView button is clicked, ApplicationView:
  - Removes all pages to the right of the current menu page (except TitleScreenView).
  - Appends the new page corresponding to the clicked button.
  - Scrolls to the newly added page.

5. JSON Configuration Example Used

{
  "viewClass": "MenuPageView",
  "children": [
    {
      "viewClass": "MenuPageView",
      "label": "Tour",
      "children": [
        {
          "viewClass": "PlaceholderPageView",
          "label": "Location A",
          "data": { "title": "Location A" }
        },
        {
          "viewClass": "PlaceholderPageView",
          "label": "Location B",
          "data": { "title": "Location B" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "viewClass": "PlaceholderPageView",
      "label": "Browse",
      "data": { "title": "Browse placeholder" }
    },
    {
      "viewClass": "PlaceholderPageView",
      "label": "Extras",
      "data": { "title": "Extras placeholder" }
    }
  ]
}

This tests nested menus inside the root menu.

Key Code Highlights

ApplicationView: Page Management and Removal Logic

- When a menu button is pressed, ApplicationView:
  - Finds the index of the current menu page in views array.
  - Removes all pages after that index (the pages to the right).
  - Adds the new page at the end.
  - Scrolls to the new page.

This ensures a clean linear navigation without leaving stale pages open.

MenuPageView: Button Callback

- MenuPageView exposes a method to set a button callback closure:
  func setButtonCallback(_ callback: @escaping (PageData) -> Void)
- When a button is pressed, calls this closure with the relevant PageData.

---

To Remember For Tomorrow

- The TitleScreenView remains untouched and is always at index 0.
- The root menu page is appended after the title screen (index 1).
- When navigating deeper, pages are appended and scrolling is handled smoothly.
- Removal of pages is crucial to avoid leftover pages cluttering the stack.
- JSON structure supports nested menus.

---

Potential Next Steps (Suggestions)

- Enhance PlaceholderPageView or add more view types.
- Load JSON from a file or remote source instead of hardcoded string.
- Add unit/UI tests for navigation and page lifecycle.

File: ContentView.swift (current state)

The entire ContentView, including all classes and structs, was finalized and tested with the nested menu JSON above.

If you need me to prepare that file or anything else for tomorrow, just let me know!
