 This file describes the SplashPageView class, a UIKit-based UIViewController subclass that manages and displays
 a sequence of full-screen splash scenes on iPadOS 17. Each scene is represented by a SplashSceneView subclass,
 which provides its own visual content and duration.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Purpose and Responsibilities:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - SplashPageView is responsible for presenting a linear sequence of splash scenes in fullscreen mode.
 - It handles the timing, animation, and lifecycle of each splash scene, ensuring a smooth, visually consistent
   user experience during app launch or intermediate branding screens.
 - The class acts as the sole orchestrator of the splash sequence, completely encapsulating all animation logic,
   timer management, interruption handling, and cleanup.
 - It exposes a minimal public API to start the splash sequence (`run()`) and notify completion (`onFinish` closure).

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Scene Presentation and Animation Flow:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Scenes:
    - The sequence of scenes is stored as an array of SplashSceneView subclasses, currently:
      SplashScenePresents and SplashSceneTitle.
    - Each scene provides a `duration` property specifying how long it should remain fully visible before transitioning.
    - SplashPageView treats scenes as black boxes; it does not inspect or alter their content or appearance.

 2. Slide-in and Slide-out Animation:
    - The splash sequence begins with a blank screen.
    - Each scene initially positions offscreen to the right (x = +view width).
    - To present a scene:
       - It slides in from right to fill the screen over a 2-second animation with ease-in-out curve.
       - After its duration elapses, the current scene slides off left (x = -view width) over 2 seconds,
         simultaneously as the next scene slides in from the right.
    - The last scene slides off to the left at the end of its duration, leaving a blank screen.
    - Animations are performed using UIView.animate with synchronized durations and options.

 3. Timer and Transition Management:
    - The class uses Swift concurrency (`async/await` with Task.sleep) to implement timers non-blockingly.
    - It tracks the current scene index and the currently displayed scene view.
    - Transitions are guarded by an `isTransitioning` flag to prevent animation overlap or race conditions.
    - When the current sceneâ€™s duration completes, `transitionToNextScene()` is invoked to animate the transition.
    - If the sequence completes (all scenes shown and slid off), the `onFinish` closure is called to notify the caller.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Lifecycle and Interruptions:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - SplashPageView observes system notifications:
     - UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification: Pauses the splash sequence by invalidating timers and
       stopping animations.
     - UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification: Restarts the entire splash sequence from scratch.
     - UIDevice.orientationDidChangeNotification: Also restarts the entire splash sequence on device rotation.
 
 - Restarting resets all internal state, removes all subviews, and starts fresh with the first scene.
 - This guarantees a consistent UX on interruptions or orientation changes, avoiding partial or inconsistent splash displays.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Design Considerations:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - UIKit chosen instead of SwiftUI views to ensure full control over precise animation timing, frame positioning,
   and compatibility with iPadOS 17 environment.
 
 - Encapsulation:
    - SplashPageView owns the full lifecycle and presentation of splash scenes.
    - It treats SplashSceneView subclasses as black boxes responsible only for their own UI content and duration.
    - This separation preserves modularity and allows independent scene implementation or reuse elsewhere.
 
 - Animation Consistency:
    - All transitions have the same 2-second ease-in-out duration, providing smooth, predictable UX.
    - Coordinated slide-in/slide-out animations ensure seamless scene handoff.
 
 - Asynchronous Timer Approach:
    - Using async/await and Task.sleep improves readability and avoids common issues with timers (retaining cycles,
      firing off main thread, complex invalidation).
    - The timer Tasks are properly cancelled on interruptions to avoid unexpected behavior.
 
 - Robustness:
    - Transition guards prevent overlapping animations.
    - Restart logic cleans up state and timers thoroughly.
    - Notifications handle app lifecycle and orientation changes gracefully.
 
 - Maintainability:
    - Clear separation of concerns between SplashPageView orchestration and SplashSceneView UI.
    - Minimal and clear public API: run() and onFinish callback.
    - Internal state variables are private and well-defined.
    - Well-commented methods and consistent naming aid future readability.
 
 - Performance:
    - Animations use hardware-accelerated UIView animations.
    - No unnecessary view hierarchy complexity or retention.
    - Scene views are removed promptly after sliding off.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Integration Context:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Typically embedded in a SwiftUI app via UIViewControllerRepresentable wrapper (e.g., ContentView.swift).
 - ContentView creates SplashPageView, sets the onFinish closure, and calls run() to start the splash sequence.
 - After splash finishes, control can pass to main app UI or other content.
 - Splash scenes (Presents, Title) are simple UILabel-based placeholders but can be replaced with richer UI if needed.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Future Notes for Developers:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - When adding new splash scenes:
    - Add new SplashSceneView subclasses with appropriate duration.
    - Append them to the `scenes` array in `setupScenes()`.
    - The transition logic will handle seamless presentation automatically.
 
 - If splash scenes require dynamic content or customization, consider passing data on initialization or exposing
   configuration methods in SplashSceneView subclasses.
 
 - The `onFinish` callback can be expanded to allow passing info back or trigger more complex app transitions.
 
 - Watch out for multiple rapid calls to `run()`; the current guard `isTransitioning` helps, but additional state checks
   could be implemented if needed.
 
 - If future requirements include pause/resume mid-scene, timer handling will need more stateful control.
 
 - Orientation change restart ensures layout is recalculated and no partial animations persist.
 
 - Consider adding accessibility support if splash screens contain important info.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Summary:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SplashPageView is a fully self-contained UIKit component designed for iPadOS 17 to show a series of splash screens
 with smooth slide-in and slide-out animations, timed durations, and robust lifecycle handling.

 Its clean API and modular design enable easy integration into SwiftUI apps, maintainable extension with new scenes,
 and consistent user experience across interruptions and orientation changes.
