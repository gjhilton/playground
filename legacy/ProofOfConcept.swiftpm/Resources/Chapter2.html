    <h1>Chapter 2: The Castle</h1>
    <p><i>7 May.â€”I slept little last night, and although when I went to bed I could not sleep, I must have gone to sleep all the same, for I was not aware of anything until the morning when I awoke.</i></p>
    <p>Jonathan Harker arrives at Castle Dracula and is greeted by the Count himself. The castle is imposing and strange, and Harker soon realizes he is more a prisoner than a guest.</p>
